Log Laravel requests and responses for statistical purposes and optionally aggregate by hours/days/months for minimal db requirements.

| Version | Laravel     | PHP                              |
|---------|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 1.*     | 8.* \| 9.*  | 7.4.* \| 8.0.* \| 8.1.*          |
| 2.*     | 10.*        | 8.1.* \| 8.2.*                   |
| 3.*     | 11.*        | 8.1.* \| 8.2.* \| 8.3.* \| 8.4.* |

## Description

Log requests and group them together for aggregated statistics of route usage. Grouping requests by route means that this package saves a minimum of data to the database and subsequent purging of old data can improve this even further.

This package lets you:

- See how much each user uses the application and what part of the application they use
- See if any unauthenticated users are making a lot of requests to your application


## Installation

You can install the package via composer:

```bash
composer require bilfeldt/laravel-route-statistics
```

You can publish and run the migrations with:

```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bilfeldt\LaravelRouteStatistics\LaravelRouteStatisticsServiceProvider" --tag="migrations"
php artisan migrate
```

You can publish the config file with:
```bash
php artisan vendor:publish --provider="Bilfeldt\LaravelRouteStatistics\LaravelRouteStatisticsServiceProvider" --tag="config"
```

## Usage

There are a few ways to enable logging of route usage:

### Enable global logging

This will enable site-wide logging and although being the easiest implementation this might not be exactly what you are looking for (consider only logging relevant routes using the [middleware](#enable-via-middleware) approach below)

Simply add `RouteStatisticsMiddleware` as a global middleware in `app/Http/Kernel.php`

```php
// app/Http/Kernel.php
<?php

namespace App\Http;

use Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Kernel as HttpKernel;

class Kernel extends HttpKernel
{
    /**
     * The application's global HTTP middleware stack.
     *
     * These middleware are run during every request to your application.
     *
     * @var array
     */
    protected $middleware = [
        \Bilfeldt\LaravelRouteStatistics\Http\Middleware\RouteStatisticsMiddleware::class, // <-- Added
        // \App\Http\Middleware\TrustHosts::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\TrustProxies::class,
        \Fruitcake\Cors\HandleCors::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\PreventRequestsDuringMaintenance::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ValidatePostSize::class,
        \App\Http\Middleware\TrimStrings::class,
        \Illuminate\Foundation\Http\Middleware\ConvertEmptyStringsToNull::class,
    ];
...
```

### Enable via middleware

Instead of adding `RouteStatisticsMiddleware` as a global middleware then it can be added to certain routes or route groups using:

```php
Route::middleware(['routestatistics'])->...
```

### Enable using request macro

It is possible to enable logging ad-hoc, usually within a controller, which is useful for any conditional logging:

```php
<?php

namespace App\Http\Controllers;

use Illuminate\Http\Request;

class HomeController extends Controller
{
    /**
     * Create a new controller instance.
     *
     * @return void
     */
    public function __construct()
    {
        $this->middleware('auth');
    }

    /**
     * Show the application dashboard.
     *
     * @return \Illuminate\Contracts\Support\Renderable
     */
    public function index(Request $request)
    {
        $request->routeStatistics(); // This will enable route statistics logging
    
        return view('home');
    }
}
```

## Artisan commands

This package comes with two neat Artisan commands:

- `route:stats`: An easy way to see route statistics for certain relevant routes.
- `route:unused`: A neat way to list the routes without any logs. Be aware that the routes should also be logged for this to be useful.

## How it works

This package works as follows:
1. Tag the request for logging: Can be done using middleware or request helper
2. (optional) Add any context data which will be used when logging: A common use case is adding relevant route parameters like a `team_id` for example
3. Log the request: Persist the log record to the database - the following will be logged when using the default logger:
  - `user_id`: The authenticated user (if any)
  - `team_id`: The team id associated with the request (if available)
  - `method`: The HTTP method (`GET/POST/...`)
  - `route`: The route name (if available) or the route URI (eg `/posts/{post}`)
  - `parameters`: The route parameters passed (if enabled else `null`)
  - `status`: The HTTP status (eg `202`)
  - `ip`: The request ip
  - `date`: The date of the request as datetime (can be aggregated)
  - `counter`: Number of requests logged when aggregating records by minute/hour/day/month...
